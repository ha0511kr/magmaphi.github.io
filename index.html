    <h2>History of Lockheed Martin</h2>
  	<p>Lockheed Martin were originally two different companies; Lockheed, and Glenn L. Martin. Both companies were founded in 1912 and both made aircraft. Glenn L. Martin merged with American-Marietta (a mining company) in 1961 to form Martin Marietta. In 1995 Martin Marietta and Lockheed merged to form Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin also owns Sandia Corporation which operates Sandia National Laboratories (which is technically owned by the United States’ government) who does research in nuclear systems, national security, and energy, Lockheed Martin also owns Sikorsky Aircraft who make a lot of helicopters.</p>
